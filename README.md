<br>This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Sephoraâ€™s product performance across various brands, categories, and pricing segments. It offers valuable insights into customer engagement, ratings, discounts, and sales trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
## Objective 
## Dataset 
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset: <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/all-products-available-on-sephora-website">Sephora_data</a>
## Key insights and recommendations
Top-Rated and Most-Loved Products Are Primarily Makeup Items

    <li>Products like <strong>Blush, Foundation, Lipstick, and Face Masks</strong> receive high engagement and ratings, indicating strong customer preference for essential makeup and skincare.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Focus marketing efforts on these high-performing categories, introduce new shades or variations, and create bundle offers to increase sales.</li>
<br>  Discounts Do Not Always Drive Customer Engagement
<li>Categories like <strong>Foundation and Mascara</strong> have high review volumes despite lower discounts, while higher-discounted categories, such as <strong>Value & Gift Sets</strong>, have fewer reviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Prioritize promotions on products that already have high organic engagement rather than relying solely on discount-driven sales. Test loyalty-based rewards instead of broad discounts.</li>
    
<br>Luxury Skincare Products Have Lower Engagement
<li>High-priced categories like <strong>Serums, Facial Rollers, and Anti-Aging Treatments</strong> receive less customer love compared to mid-range makeup products.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Improve product positioning by enhancing customer education, offering trial sizes, and leveraging influencer marketing to increase trust and visibility in the premium skincare segment.</li>
