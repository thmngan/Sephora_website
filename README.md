## Key insights and recommendations
<h3>1. Top-Rated and Most-Loved Products Are Primarily Makeup Items</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Products like <strong>Blush, Foundation, Lipstick, and Face Masks</strong> receive high engagement and ratings, indicating strong customer preference for essential makeup and skincare.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Focus marketing efforts on these high-performing categories, introduce new shades or variations, and create bundle offers to increase sales.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Discounts Do Not Always Drive Customer Engagement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Categories like <strong>Foundation and Mascara</strong> have high review volumes despite lower discounts, while higher-discounted categories, such as <strong>Value & Gift Sets</strong>, have fewer reviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Prioritize promotions on products that already have high organic engagement rather than relying solely on discount-driven sales. Test loyalty-based rewards instead of broad discounts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Luxury Skincare Products Have Lower Engagement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>High-priced categories like <strong>Serums, Facial Rollers, and Anti-Aging Treatments</strong> receive less customer love compared to mid-range makeup products.</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Improve product positioning by enhancing customer education, offering trial sizes, and leveraging influencer marketing to increase trust and visibility in the premium skincare segment.</li>
</ul>
